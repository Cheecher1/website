<h2>Project Outline</h2>
<p><strong>In this project, we were given the datasets and asked to recreate these visuals. Many people were skeptical about the advent of mail-in ballots in the 2020 presidential election. Specifically, many pundits, news agencies, and politicians stated that mail-in ballots benifited democrats for whatever reason. In the following project, we take the state of Georgia, and figure out by county, how large the percentage of mail-in voters was.</strong>

<p><strong>The insight we have learned was that both nominees had a large portion of their votes from mail in ballots
(over 50% in almost every county for both candidates). This makes the argument that the democrats used mail in
ballots to illegally cast extra votes less believable.</strong></p>
