Hello everyone, my name is Will Cichowski and I am currently a Junior at Northwestern University studying Mathematical Methods in Social Sciences and (the soon to be major) Data Science. I love to make sense out of complex data by building different models, and use different tools to be able
to help other people understand it. In my free time, I like to play basketball, poker, and watch anime.
